## Enhanced loop

Java 5 introduced an for-each loop, which is called a enhanced for each loop. It is used to iterate over elements of an array and the collection. for-each loop is a shortcut version of for-loop which skips the need to get the iterator and loop over iterator using it's hasNext() and next() method.
